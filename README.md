Colorblock is the first NFT platform built on Kadena network. Thanks to the power of Kadena, users are able to store their NFT tokens on blockchain permenently without any gas fees but safely and fast.

## Features

### On-Chain

All artwork associated with each NFT is stored and located on chain. All NFTs are deployed onto Kadena's braided multi-chain proof of work network.

### No Fees

Kadena's Gas Station feature allows ColorBlock to subsidize gas fees for users allowing for feeless minting! Never has it been easier to get started with NFTs on ColorBlock.

### Polyfungible

ColorBlock adopts KIP-0011, giving users the option of fractional ownership and custody of NFTs. Customize your NFT in our Creator!
